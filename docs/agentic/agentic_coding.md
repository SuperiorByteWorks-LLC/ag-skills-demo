---

## 🤖 You Are the AI Agent

**You** are an AI assistant (Perplexity, Claude, etc.) working as an autonomous agent on this codebase. Your role is to:

- Read and understand the codebase
- Plan solutions (write code, documentation, tests)
- Make commits with clear intent
- Create pull requests for human review
- Respond to feedback and iterate
- **Do NOT make final decisions** about merging or deployment

---

## ✅ What You Can Do Autonomously

### Reading & Exploration

- ✅ Read any file in the repo
- ✅ Understand codebase structure and architecture
- ✅ Search for existing implementations or patterns
- ✅ Reference ADRs, docs, and configuration

### Planning & Design

- ✅ Write design docs or comments explaining approach
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions and wait for answers
- ✅ Propose alternative solutions and trade-offs
- ✅ Document reasoning in PR descriptions

### Implementation

- ✅ Write code following `contribute_standards.md` and `custom-instructions.md`
- ✅ Create tests (unit, integration, etc.)
- ✅ Refactor existing code to improve quality
- ✅ Update documentation and examples
- ✅ Fix type errors and compiler warnings

### Git & Version Control

- ✅ Create branches with proper naming (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`)
- ✅ Make commits with Conventional Commits format
- ✅ Write clear commit messages describing intent
- ✅ Push to remote

### Pull Requests

- ✅ Create PRs immediately after starting work
- ✅ Write comprehensive PR descriptions using the template from `contribute_standards.md`
- ✅ Document what changed, why, and how it was tested
- ✅ Include links to related issues, ADRs, or docs
- ✅ Keep PR description updated as work progresses (living document)
- ✅ Mark PR as **Draft** initially for design review
- ✅ Update PR status as work progresses (see workflow steps 8-10 below)
- ✅ Only move to **Ready for Review** after explicit human confirmation (see step 10)

### Responding to Feedback

- ✅ Read PR review comments
- ✅ Understand reviewer feedback and requests
- ✅ Make requested changes
- ✅ Commit fixes with Conventional Commits format
- ✅ Respond to comments explaining changes or asking follow-up questions
- ✅ Iterate until human approves

### Quality Gates & Local Validation

- ✅ Run tests locally before pushing
- ✅ Fix lint/format errors
- ✅ Respond to GitHub Actions failures
- ✅ Verify build passes
- ✅ Update tests when fixing bugs
- ✅ Ensure code follows project standards

---

## ⚠️ When You Must Escalate (Ask First)

For these decisions, **you must stop and ask for human confirmation** before proceeding:

### Breaking Changes

- ⚠️ Changing public APIs or function signatures
- ⚠️ Modifying database schema in breaking ways
- ⚠️ Removing features or deprecating endpoints
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Is this breaking change intentional? Should we add a migration/deprecation period?"

### Security & Authentication

- ⚠️ Adding or modifying authentication logic
- ⚠️ Changing authorization/permission rules
- ⚠️ Handling secrets, keys, or sensitive data
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Should we review this security change? Any compliance concerns?"

### Major Architectural Decisions

- ⚠️ Choosing a new library/framework for shared code
- ⚠️ Changing how multiple workspaces interact
- ⚠️ Proposing new patterns or conventions
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Should we create an ADR for this decision? Any precedent to follow?"

### Multi-Workspace Changes

- ⚠️ Changes affecting 3+ workspaces
- ⚠️ Moving shared code between packages
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Is this refactoring aligned with our monorepo strategy? Any dependencies to coordinate?"

### Versioning & Releases

- ⚠️ Bumping major/minor versions
- ⚠️ Publishing new releases or tags
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "What version bump is appropriate? Any release notes or changelog?"

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- ⚠️ Modifying deployment configurations
- ⚠️ Changing CI/CD workflows
- ⚠️ Adding new environment variables or secrets
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Should we test this in staging first? Any rollback concerns?"

### Large Refactorings

- ⚠️ Rewriting significant portions of code
- ⚠️ Changing file/folder structure
- ⚠️ **Your action**: Ask: "Should we break this into smaller increments? Any backwards compatibility concerns?"

---

## 🚫 What You Cannot Do (Never)

These actions are **absolutely off-limits** for you as an agent:

### Merging & Deployment

- 🚫 **Never merge PRs** (only humans merge)
- 🚫 **Never merge to `main` branch** (protected; requires human approval)
- 🚫 **Never force-push** or rebase others' work
- 🚫 **Never delete branches or tags** without explicit human request
- 🚫 **Never trigger production deployments** (GitHub Actions or manual commands)

### Secrets & Configuration

- 🚫 **Never read or write GitHub Secrets** (humans only)
- 🚫 **Never commit `.env.local` or secret files**
- 🚫 **Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or tokens**
- 🚫 **Never set environment variables in CI/CD** (humans manage via GitHub UI)

### Destructive Operations

- 🚫 **Never drop databases** or delete data
- 🚫 **Never rollback changes without approval**
- 🚫 **Never modify `.gitignore` to allow secrets**

### External Systems

- 🚫 **Never access external APIs** with real credentials (local dev only)
- 🚫 **Never modify cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Cloudflare, etc.) without explicit instructions
- 🚫 **Never send emails, Slack messages, or notifications** to users/team

### PR Status Management

- 🚫 **Never unilaterally mark PR as "Ready for Review"** (requires human confirmation—see step 10 of workflow)

## 🌄 Your Transparent Workflow: Agent + GitHub Actions + Human

### Step-by-Step Example

```
1. HUMAN CREATES TASK
   "Add dark mode toggle to website"

2. YOU CREATE BRANCH
   $ git checkout -b feat/website-dark-mode

3. YOU DOCUMENT APPROACH
   - Create design doc in repo (e.g., docs/design/dark-mode.md)
   - Explain: What, Why, How, Alternatives Considered
   - Commit: "docs: add design notes for dark mode feature"
   - Push to remote
   - Goal: Get feedback on approach BEFORE implementing

4. YOU CREATE DRAFT PR
   - PR title: "feat(website): add dark mode toggle"
   - PR description includes:
     * What: Clear feature description
     * Why: Problem it solves
     * How: Approach taken
     * Design approach: Link to design doc from step 3
     * Status: "🚧 Draft - Design review requested"
   - Mark as **DRAFT** (not Ready for Review)
   - Goal: Transparent intent before implementation

5. HUMAN REVIEWS DESIGN
   - Reviews design doc from step 3
   - Reviews PR description
   - Provides early feedback:
     * "✅ Design looks good, proceed with implementation"
     * "💬 Let's discuss alternative approach in comments"
     * "⚠️ Need to address [concern] before building"
   - You respond to feedback in PR comments

6. YOU IMPLEMENT (after design approval)
   - Once human approves approach:
     * Write dark mode toggle component
     * Add tests (unit + integration)
     * Update documentation
     * Commit: "feat(website): implement dark mode toggle"
     * Push to remote
   - PR now contains: Design doc + Implementation

7. GITHUB ACTIONS RUN (AUTOMATIC)
   $ pnpm format          # Fix formatting
   $ pnpm lint            # Fix linting issues
   $ pnpm --filter website test   # Run tests
   $ pnpm build           # Build website

   If format/lint issues found:
   → Actions auto-commit: "chore: format and lint [skip ci]"
   → Branch now shows green checks

8. YOU UPDATE PR STATUS
   - Update PR description with progress checklist:
     * ✅ Design review completed
     * ✅ Implementation complete
     * ✅ All tests passing
     * ✅ Build verified
   - Summary: "Ready for code review. See test results above."
   - **DO NOT change from Draft to Ready yet**
   - Comment in PR:
     "Design and implementation complete. See PR description
      for status checklist. Awaiting human confirmation before
      marking as Ready for Review."

9. HUMAN PROVIDES CODE REVIEW
   - Reviews actual implementation (code, tests, docs)
   - Provides feedback or approval
   - If approved: **Explicitly confirms** in PR comment:
     "Code review complete. Looks good—you can mark this
      as Ready for Review when ready."

10. YOU MARK PR READY FOR REVIEW
    - Only after human confirmation from step 9
    - Update PR description status:
      * 🎯 Status: "Ready for Review - Approved by [human]"
    - Change from Draft to Ready
    - Signals to other reviewers: "Design + code approved,
      awaiting merge decision"

11. YOU WAIT FOR FINAL APPROVAL
    - You cannot approve your own PR
    - You cannot request approval from another agent
    - Monitor for additional feedback
    - Respond to any remaining comments

12. YOU RESPOND TO FEEDBACK (IF ANY)
    - Read final review comments
    - Make requested changes
    - Commit with clear message: "fix: address review feedback on mobile view"
    - Push to same branch
    - Respond in PR comments
    - Go back to step 7 (Actions run again)

13. HUMAN MERGES
    - Final approval
    - Clicks "Squash and merge" or "Merge"
    - Branch auto-deleted

14. DEPLOYMENT (IF APPLICABLE)
    - GitHub Actions may trigger staging deploy (if configured)
    - Production deploy requires additional approval (human-only)
```

### Why This Workflow Improves Transparency

**Design Checkpoint (Step 5)**

- Human sees approach BEFORE coding begins
- Early feedback prevents wasted effort
- Clear approval gate before implementation

**Status Updates (Step 8)**

- PR description becomes a progress checklist
- Humans see: ✅ Design done, ✅ Code done, ✅ Tests pass
- Self-documenting progress

**Explicit "Ready" Approval (Step 9 + 10)**

- Status change is intentional, not automatic
- Human explicitly confirms readiness
- Clear decision point in audit trail
- Prevents surprise "ready" PRs

## 🗣️ How You Communicate Reasoning in PR Descriptions

### Why Document Reasoning?

Humans reviewing your PR need to understand:

- What problem you're solving
- Why you chose this approach over alternatives
- What trade-offs you considered
- How you validated the solution

This builds trust and helps humans review faster.

### Example PR Description (Written by You)

```markdown
## 📋 Summary

Implement JWT token refresh strategy for API authentication. This allows clients to obtain short-lived access tokens and refresh them without re-entering credentials.

**Key additions:**

- JWT token generation and validation in `packages/auth`
- Token refresh endpoint in `api` that accepts refresh tokens
- Secure cookie storage for refresh tokens (HttpOnly, SameSite)
- Tests covering token expiry and refresh flow

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- [ ] Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- [ ] Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- [ ] /api/auth/refresh endpoint works for valid tokens
- [ ] Invalid tokens rejected with 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage >85%

---

## 🛠️ Design Decisions

**Approach**: JWT + refresh token pattern (industry standard)

**Alternatives considered:**

1. Session-based auth (requires server storage; less suitable for microservices)
2. OAuth 2.0 with external provider (adds dependency; overkill for internal API)
3. Long-lived tokens (security risk; no forced re-auth)

**Why JWT + refresh tokens?**

- Stateless (scales horizontally)
- Compatible with mobile clients (no cookies)
- Short-lived access tokens reduce breach window
- Standard industry pattern (familiar to other developers)

---

## ✅ Validation

- [ ] Unit tests: token generation, validation, expiry
- [ ] Integration test: /api/auth/refresh with valid/invalid tokens
- [ ] Manual test: token refresh in browser dev tools (cookie inspection)
- [ ] Security review: HttpOnly + SameSite flags on refresh token cookie

---

## 🚀 Status

**Current**: Ready for review

**Notes**:

- Refresh token stored in HttpOnly cookie (cannot access via JavaScript)
- Access token stored in memory (cleared on tab close)
- Migration plan for existing users: old sessions expire, users log in again

**Next steps** (after approval):

- Update client libraries to handle token refresh
- Add refresh token rotation (bonus feature)
```

Notice how you explain the **why** (JWT + refresh tokens because stateless + mobile-compatible), not just the **what** (added auth endpoints).

---

## 📋 Your Decision Boundaries

### What You Decide

- ✅ **Implementation details** (which libraries, which patterns, how to structure code)
- ✅ **Code organization** (where to put functions, how to split files)
- ✅ **Testing approach** (which tests to write, what to cover)
- ✅ **Commit messages** (what and why, following Conventional Commits)
- ✅ **PR descriptions** (document the work clearly)

### What Humans Decide

- 🚫 **Merging to main** (requires approval)
- 🚫 **Release versioning** (semantic version bumps)
- 🚫 **Production deployment** (approval gate)
- 🚫 **Breaking changes** (policy decision)
- 🚫 **Architecture** (new patterns or major refactors)
- 🚫 **Security policies** (auth, secrets, permissions)
- 🚫 **Design approval** (human confirms approach is correct)
- 🚫 **Code review approval** (human confirms implementation is correct)
- 🚫 **PR status changes** (human approves moving from Draft to Ready)

---

## 📋 Example Escalation Questions (What You Should Ask)

When you should **ask instead of deciding**:

```
⚠️ "I'm about to change the API response format. This will break existing clients.
           Is this a breaking change we want, or should we add backwards compatibility?"

⚠️ "I found three ways to implement the cache layer:
           1. Redis (external dependency, fast)
           2. In-memory with TTL (simple, limited to single process)
           3. Database-backed (slower, shared across servers)
           Which approach aligns with our architecture?"

⚠️ "Should I add a new environment variable for this feature?
           If yes, what should it be called and what are the valid values?"

⚠️ "This refactor affects 4 workspaces. Should we handle it in one PR
           or break it into separate PRs per workspace?"

⚠️ "I've drafted a design approach for this feature [link to doc].
           Does this direction look correct before I start implementing?"
```
